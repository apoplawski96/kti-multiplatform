            - view has reference to the presenter
            
            MVVM:
            - Unit testing is more straightforward because you’re not addicted to the View. It is sufficient to verify that the observable variables are properly positioned as the Model changes when testing.
            - ViewModels are even friendlier to unit testing as they simply expose state and, therefore, can be independently tested without testing how the data will be consumed. In short, there is no dependence on the view.
            - Only the View contains a reference to the ViewModel, not the other way around. This solves the tight coupling problem. A single View can reference multiple ViewModels.

            Android apps can send or receive broadcast messages from the Android system and other Android apps, similar to the publish-subscribe design pattern.
            Apps can receive broadcasts in two ways: through manifest-declared receivers and context-registered receivers.
            App targets API level 26 or higher, cannot use the manifest to declare a receiver for implicit broadcasts except for a few implicit broadcasts that are exempted from that restriction. In most cases, you can use scheduled jobs instead.
            onReceive function in BroadcastReceiver is called when the BroadcastReceiver is receiving an Intent broadcast. This method is always called within the main thread of its process, unless you explicitly asked for it to be scheduled on a different thread.
            Three ways for apps to send broadcast:
            sendOrderedBroadcast which sends broadcasts to one receiver at a time.

            sendBroadcast(Intent) which sends broadcasts to all receivers in an undefined order.

            LocalBroadcastManager.sendBroadcast which sends broadcasts to receivers that are in the same app as the sender.

            Before you declare and request runtime permissions in your app, evaluate whether your app needs to do so. You can fulfill many use cases in your app, such as taking photos, pausing media playback, and displaying relevant ads, without needing to declare any permissions.

            If you conclude that your app needs to declare and request runtime permissions, complete these steps:

            In your app's manifest file, declare the permissions that your app might need to request.
            Design your app's UX so that specific actions in your app are associated with specific runtime permissions. Users should know which actions might require them to grant permission for your app to access private user data.
            Wait for the user to invoke the task or action in your app that requires access to specific private user data. At that time, your app can request the runtime permission that's required for accessing that data.
            Check whether the user has already granted the runtime permission that your app requires. If so, your app can access the private user data. If not, continue to the next step.

            You must check whether you have that permission every time you perform an operation that requires that permission.

            Check whether your app should show a rationale to the user, explaining why your app needs the user to grant a particular runtime permission. If the system determines that your app shouldn't show a rationale, continue to the next step directly, without showing a UI element.

            If the system determines that your app should show a rationale, however, present the rationale to the user in a UI element. This rationale should clearly explain what data your app is trying to access, and what benefits the app can provide to the user if they grant the runtime permission. After the user acknowledges the rationale, continue to the next step.

            Request the runtime permission that your app requires in order to access the private user data. The system displays a runtime permission prompt, such as the one shown on the permissions overview page.

            Check the user's response, whether they chose to grant or deny the runtime permission.

            If the user granted the permission to your app, you can access the private user data. If the user denied the permission instead, gracefully degrade your app experience so that it provides functionality to the user, even without the information that's protected by that permission.
