            Each app, by default, has access only to the components that it requires to do its work and no more.
            This creates a very secure environment in which an app cannot access parts of the system for which it is not given permission. However, there are ways for an app to share data with other apps and for an app to access system services:

            It's possible to arrange for two apps to share the same Linux user ID, in which case they are able to access each other's files. To conserve system resources, apps with the same user ID can also arrange to run in the same Linux process and share the same VM. The apps must also be signed with the same certificate.
            An app can request permission to access device data such as the device's location, camera, and Bluetooth connection. The user has to explicitly grant these permissions. For more information, see Working with System Permissions.

To simplify the different configurations, Android generalizes these variants into groups that make them easier to target:

            Four generalized sizes: small, normal, large, and xlarge.

            The screen size is the visible space provided for your app UI. The screen size as it's known to your app is not the actual size of the device screen—it takes into account the screen orientation, system decorations (such as the navigation bar), and window configuration changes (such as when the user enables multi-window mode).
            
            Flexible layouts - By default, Android resizes your app layout to fit the current screen. To ensure your layout resizes well for even small variations in screen size, you need to implement your layout with flexibility in mind. The core principle you must follow is to avoid hard-coding the position and size of your UI components. Instead, allow view sizes to stretch and specify view positions relative to the parent view or other sibling views so your intended order and relative sizes remain the same as the layout grows.
            
            Alternative layouts - A flexible layout is very important, but you should also design different layouts that optimize the user experience for the available space on different devices such as phones and tablets. So Android allows you to provide alternative layout files that the system applies at runtime based on the current device's screen size.

            Stretchable images - Because your layout should stretch to fit the current screen, so too should the bitmaps that you attach to any of the layout views. However, stretching an ordinary bitmap in arbitrary directions can result in strange scaling artifacts and skewed images.
            To solve this, Android supports nine-patch bitmaps in which you specify small pixel regions that are stretchable—the rest of the image remain unscaled.

            Not only do Android devices come in different screen sizes (handsets, tablets, TVs, and so on), but their screens also have different pixel sizes. That is, while one device has 160 pixels per square inch, another device fits 480 pixels in the same space. If you don't consider these variations in pixel density, the system might scale your images (resulting in blurry images) or the images might appear at the completely wrong size.
            
            Your app achieves "density independence" when it preserves the physical size (from the user's point of view) of your UI design when displayed on screens with different pixel densities (as shown in figure 2). Maintaining density independence is important because, without it, a UI element (such as a button) might appear larger on a low-density screen and smaller on a high-density screen (because when the pixels are larger—as shown in figure 2—a few pixels can go a long way).

            The Android system helps you achieve density independence by providing density-independent pixels (dp or dip) as a unit of measurement that you should use instead of pixels (px).
            For texts we should use sp instead of dp.
            
            To provide good graphical qualities on devices with different pixel densities, you should provide multiple versions of each bitmap in your app—one for each density bucket, at a corresponding resolution.

            Android Auto, or Chrome OS devices, you need to do a bit more work.

            Each of these devices have their own user interaction model that your app should accommodate. In some cases, such as for Wear OS, you should re-think your app's user experience and build an app that's specialized for that device. And to support Chrome OS devices (such as the Google Pixelbook), you might need only slight modifications to your existing app to support keyboard/mouse interaction and a much larger screen.
